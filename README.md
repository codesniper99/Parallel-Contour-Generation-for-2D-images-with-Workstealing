# Parallel-Contour-Generation-for-2D-images-with-Workstealing
In computer graphics, marching squares is an algorithm that generates contours for a two-dimensional scalar field (rectangular array of individual numerical values). A similar method can be used to contour 2D triangle meshes. This project aims to parallelize it with a BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel Pattern) and Work stealing refinement
